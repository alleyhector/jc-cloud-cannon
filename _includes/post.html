                <p><em><strong>Additional sponsors include Horizon,
                SUEZ North America, CarePoint, and Jersey City Medical
                Center – Barnabas Health</strong></em></p>

                <p><em>Program will create new, affordable
                transportation option for Jersey City and be
                interoperable with New York City’s Citi Bike program</em></p>

                <p>Jersey City—Mayor Steven M. Fulop and Jay Walder,
                President &amp; CEO of Motivate, today announced
                sponsors for Jersey City’s new bike share program
                launching in September. Citi will be the Title
                Sponsor, and the bike share program will be named Citi
                Bike. Citi Bike Jersey City and Citi Bike New York
                will be interoperable programs, meaning membership to
                one will entitle riders to the same usage in sister
                market. Four additional organizations– the Horizon
                Foundation for New Jersey, SUEZ North America,
                CarePoint Health and Jersey City Medical
                Center–Barnabas Health have been named Founding
                Sponsors. The program’s website <a href="http://www.citibikejc.com/" title="http://www.citibikejc.com/" target="_blank">www.citibikejc.com</a> launched today as well.</p>

                <p>As part of the sponsorship agreements the Title
                Partner will have their name integrated into the
                program and exclusive branding on all bikes.&nbsp; The
                Founding Partners will have customized benefits that
                include recognition and advertising at designated
                stations, recognition on the website and in program
                materials, and community based events.</p>


                <p>The program will launch with 350 bikes at 35
                stations, providing a new, environmentally friendly,
                healthy and affordable 24/7 transportation option for
                Jersey City. Jersey City has added 22 new miles of
                bike lanes over the past two years and bike share
                represents the next big step in creating a more
                bike-friendly city.&nbsp; </p>

                <p>“Jersey City is a diverse community with residents
                who largely use bikes, mass transit or walk to work
                and the city’s culture and vibrancy make it the
                perfect place for bike share,” said Mayor Fulop. “We
                know what a huge success our bike share program will
                be and want to thank Citi, the Horizon Foundation,
                SUEZ North America, CarePoint, and Jersey City Medical
                Center-Barnabas Health for joining the initiative as
                they recognize the benefits this will provide the
                community.”</p>

                <p>“We appreciate the dedication of Mayor Fulop, Citi,
                the Horizon Foundation, SUEZ North America, CarePoint,
                and Jersey City Medical Center-Barnabas Health to
                bringing a regionally integrated bike share program to
                Jersey City,” said Jay Walder, President and CEO of
                Motivate. “Citi Bike has already proven to be wildly
                popular in New York City with over 19 million trips in
                a little over two years. We’re now expanding the
                reach, making bike share a seamless part of the
                region’s transportation network.”</p>

                <p>“When we took steps to help make the Citi Bike
                program a reality in New York, we had high hopes for
                it, but we never imagined it would have this kind of
                impact on people’s lives,” said Elyse Lesley, Managing
                Director, Citi U.S. Consumer and Commercial Banking
                and CitiMortgage. “Today, we are thrilled to join
                Mayor Fulop and Motivate to help introduce the program
                in Jersey City and bring there the wide-ranging
                benefits of this sustainable, healthy and convenient
                service.”</p>

                <p>“The Horizon Foundation for New Jersey is proud to
                be a Founding Sponsor and join Mayor Fulop in
                fulfilling his vision to bring New Jersey’s first bike
                share program to Jersey City,” said Robert A. Marino,
                Chairman, Horizon Foundation for New Jersey and
                Chairman and CEO, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of
                New Jersey. “Horizon cares about improving the health
                of the residents in the diverse communities we serve,
                so promoting physical activity through an innovative
                bike share program will encourage residents and
                visitors to get their fitness routine into gear.”</p>

                <p>“Teaming up with Mayor Fulop and the City of Jersey
                City to deliver a bike-share program was an easy
                decision for SUEZ North America,” said Bertrand Camus,
                CEO of SUEZ North America. “As an environmental
                company, we strive to support initiatives that will
                help people think “green” and encourage them to lead a
                healthier lifestyle for themselves and the
                planet.”&nbsp; </p>

                <p>“As a member of the Jersey City Community we are
                proud to be a founding sponsor of Citi Bike,” said
                CarePoint Health System CEO Dennis Kelly. “With a
                large number of our employees living and working here,
                we are excited to help improve the quality of life in
                the city we call home.”</p>

                <p>“Jersey City Medical Center is proud to be a
                sponsor of the Jersey City Bike Share program and to
                have a bike docking station on our campus.&nbsp; Bike
                riding will help reduce traffic congestion and car
                emissions and, at the same time, provide a healthy
                transportation alternative,” said Joseph F. Scott
                FACHE President and CEO – Jersey City Medical Center,
                a Barnabas Health facility.&nbsp; “At Barnabas Health,
                we believe ‘Life is better healthy.’ This program
                encourages exercise, an important component of our
                mission for healthier lifestyles. We thank Mayor Fulop
                for bringing Bike Share to Jersey City and, as a
                Jersey City resident, I look forward to taking part in
                this easy and convenient means of transportation.”</p>
